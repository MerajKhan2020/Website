  <p1><strong>About Us</strong></p1>
  <br>
  <p2>We believe that high-end fashion photography shouldn’t be exclusive to high-end fashion models. Founded in 2007, MK Photo Studio blurs the line between editorial fashion photography and personal portraiture. Located in heart of Sydney CBD, our studio’s offer people the chance to step out of their comfort zones and spend a day playing adult dress-ups with the professionals.
Ultimately our mission is to help people to see beauty in themselves while creating wonderful works of art that will be passed down through generations.
